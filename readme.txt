Prepare WP categorized image galleries including more than 500 photos with preloader techique without decreasing initial page loading performance.  

== Description ==
User friendly & high performance Category Gallery. 

By using the media category structure provided by WP Media Category Management or other media category management plugins using wp_term_taxonomy, prepare new categorized image galleries. Seperate category structures or reloading media are not required like in other image galleries. Categorize the image files in your existing media library  by using WP category structure and easily add the gallery to your pages without any additional adjustment. 

Moreover, you can add galleries that include many media files to your page with preloader technique without any hesitation. Media files will be loaded as you slide them. Thus, your initial page loading performance will not be decreased.
